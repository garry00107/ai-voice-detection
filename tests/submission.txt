How to Use the Endpoint Tester

This tool helps participants verify that their API endpoint is working as expected for the AI-Generated Voice Detection (Multi-Language) problem.

Steps:

Enter your deployed API endpoint URL
Provide the required Authorization / API key in the header
Add a short message describing the test request (for reference)
Provide a valid audio file URL pointing to an MP3 voice sample
Click Test Endpoint to send the request
What This Tests:

API authentication using headers
Ability to receive and process audio input
Correct request parsing and validation
Proper JSON response formatting
API stability and response behavior
Note: This tester is for validation purposes only. The final evaluation will use a separate automated system with official voice samples.
Submission Rules & Guidelines

Endpoint Submission Rules

Participants must submit one public API endpoint URL
The endpoint must correspond to the selected problem statement
The endpoint must be live, accessible, and stable during evaluation
Participants must provide a valid API key for authentication
Late or non-working endpoints will not be evaluated


What the Evaluation System Will Do

Send official test inputs to your endpoint
Validate authentication using the API key
Check request handling and response structure
Evaluate the correctness and stability of your solution


Applicable for Both Problems

Problem 1: AI-Generated Voice Detection — Your API must accept audio input and return classification results
Problem 2: Agentic Honey-Pot — Your API must accept scam messages and return extracted intelligence


Evaluation Readiness

Ensure your API handles multiple requests reliably
Ensure correct JSON response format as defined in the problem statement
Ensure low latency and proper error handling


Outcome of This Level

Your endpoint moves to the automated evaluation stage
Results and scores will be generated based on API performance
